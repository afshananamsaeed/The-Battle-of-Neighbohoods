    "New Delhi and Toronto are the capital cities of India and Canada, respectively. They are also the major financial cities of their countries. New Delhi, being the capital of a very densely populated country boasts a population of about 1.9 crore and is highly densely populated. Canada on the other hand has a total population of 3.76 crore, with Toronto holding 29.3 lakh individuals amongst them. Different cultures in different cities tend to affect the mannerism of the functioning of the economies of these cities. The objective of this project is to analyze the service economies of these two cities on different corners of the world and see how they compare with one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the difference in the population of these two cities, the top services that are up and running in the neighborhoods and contributing majorly to the economy of that neighborhood may differ. The type of services that are preferred around a certain neighborhood speaks volumes about the income and lifestyle of the inhabitants residing over there. Thus, information about neighborhoods of the form are crucial in making decisions about setting up major businesses in the area. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project can act as a key source of information to parties considering investing in a certain service business in these two major cities. It can widely be helpful for an investor living in one of these cities and willing to invest in another. \n"

Several methods of clustering are available such as Hierarchical Clustering, Density Based Clustering, etc. K-Means is being used here because of its simplicity and the guarantee of convergence in large data sets. In this form of clustering method, the number of clusters are to be pre-defined. In this case, I will opt to segment the neighborhoods into 5 clusters each, although New Delhi should be preferably divided into greater number of clusters because of the larger number of neighborhoods present and the vast population that it holds. But to match numbers, 5 clusters have been created for both New Delhi and Toronto. "

While Indian Restaurants and Cafes make up the bulk of them in New Delhi, Coffee shops are dominating in the Toronto food space. The diversity in restaurant types is greater in Toronto than it is in New Delhi, preferably due to the greater ethnic diversity in the population of Toronto.\n",
